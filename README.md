# Pythonic Connect











Pythonic Connect is a simple recreation of New-York-Times game 'Connections'. Created by Jai Strbik I hope to create a game that embodies the original essence of the game with a bug-free, engagnig and visually appealng game.

The game randomly selects 16 words in a 4 by 4 grid. 
Your goal is to connect these 16 words 4 connections.
You have 4 guesses to guess 4 words separated each by a comma to match them into connection. Guessing 4 Connecitons in under 4 lives will result in you beating Pythonic Connect.
